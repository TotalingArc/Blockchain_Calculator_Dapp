# Blockchain_Calculator_Dapp
 ## Blockchain-Powered Calculator 🔗 (Avalanche)
A React-based calculator integrated with Avalanche blockchain to mint tokens per calculation.

 ## About the Project
This project combines React and blockchain technology, integrating a smart contract on Avalanche that mints tokens as a reward for each successful calculation. It explores tokenized incentives, Web3 authentication, and real-world blockchain applications beyond finance.

 ## Key Features

- ✅ React-Based UI – Simple and user-friendly calculator interface
- ✅ Blockchain-Connected – Smart contract mints tokens per calculation
- ✅ Avalanche-Powered – Fast, low-cost transactions for seamless execution
- ✅ Web3 Authentication – Wallet connection via MetaMask or WalletConnect
- ✅ Scalable & Decentralized – Ideal for education, gamified learning, and DeFi apps
